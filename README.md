# wav

**wav** is a dead-simple API for dealing with WAV audio files.

# Examples

I have created many examples in the form of command line utilities. These utilities are as follows:

 * [wav-crop](wav-crop/main.go) - cut a WAV file
 * [wav-duration](wav-duration/main.go) - get the duration of a WAV file
 * [wav-gradient](wav-gradient/main.go) - fade in/out a WAV file
 * [wav-overlay](wav-overlay/main.go) - play one WAV file on top of another one
 * [wav-tone](wav-tone/main.go) - generate a sinusoidal tone at a given frequency
 * [wav-volume](wav-volume/main.go) - change the volume of a WAV file
